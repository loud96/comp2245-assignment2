                        <p>Hey there, fellow adventurers of the digital realm! I'm Louetta, a data science major at the University of the West Indies, Five Islands campus. You might be wondering why a data science major is diving into the world of web development – well, let me take you on a journey through my exciting and eclectic interests.</p>
                        <p>While I'm knee-deep in data, I'm also knee-deep in hobbies. From afternoon dips in the warm Caribbean sea to experimenting with new recipes (I promise, I haven't blown up the kitchen yet), I'm always on the lookout for new experiences. But there's one thing that has truly captured my heart – tinkering with technology.
                        </p>
                        <p>I've dabbled in web development and even constructed a few WordPress websites along the way. From fiddling with the intricacies of HTML to playing around with CSS, I've found immense joy in creating and shaping the digital world around me. In this blog, I'll share my adventures as I dive headfirst into the foundations of HTML and CSS, offering insights, tips, and maybe even a sprinkle of humor along the way.</p>
                        <p>So, join me on this whimsical journey as we explore the fascinating realms of data science and web development while embracing the sunny shores of the Caribbean. Who says data can't have a sense of style?</p>

                        <p>In the ever-evolving world of technology, I lead a double life. By day, I'm your go-to IT technician, tackling hardware woes and networking puzzles. But when the sun sets, I morph into a web wizard, crafting digital marvels. My journey into web development started as a way to unwind, delving into HTML and CSS. It quickly became a passion as I embraced online tutorials, creating wordpress websites and now my first humble blog.</p>
                        <p>My transition has had many amusing mishaps – bad plugins, '404 Page Not Found' errors – they all added to the learning curve. Balancing my IT role with web development presented challenges, but the joy of creating digital experiences made it worthwhile. Now, I'm excited to share my dual life, offering insights and humor as I navigate these contrasting realms.</p>
                        <p>Join me on this intriguing journey from IT tech to web wizard. Whether you're contemplating a similar leap or seeking inspiration in your own web development journey, my tales from the tech world are here to entertain and enlighten. Stay tuned; the adventure has only just begun!</p>
